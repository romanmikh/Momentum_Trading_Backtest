# Implementation and backtesting of the momentum trading strategy, following procedure outlined in:
# https://www.pdfdrive.com/stocks-on-the-move-beating-the-market-with-hedge-fund-momentum-strategies-d194677183.html

# Data Acquisition and Processing (not part of this code):
# - obtained list of companies currently in the S&P500 from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies
# - obtained historical closing prices for 3000 US publicly-traded companies from Quandl since the 1990s:
#    https://www.quandl.com/databases/WIKIP/usage/export (warning: >450MB file)
# - reduced Quandl data to stocks in the S&P500 only
# - 'SP500_Stock_Data_Sample' should be downloaded from: https://github.com/romanmikh/Momentum_Trading_Backtest
#   'SP500_Stock_Data_Sample' contains only S&P500 companies beginning with 'A', to minimise download time + runtime


"""
Key components of the strategy, as described in Andreas F. Clenow. â€œStocks on the Move: Beating the Market with Hedge 
Fund Momentum Strategies" can be summarised as follows:

1) Momentum is defined as the product of the annualised exponential regression slope of the previous 90 days of closing
   prices and the R^2 regression coefficient.

2) For each stock: Position size = AccountValue*RiskFactor/AverageTrueRange_20. 
   - AccountValue = value of the entire trading account
   - RiskFactor = arbitrary number that sets a target daily impact for the stock. (10bp used in these calculations)
   - AverageTrueRange_20 = (price_max - price_min)/20, where 20 days has been chosen arbitrarily by the author
 
3) Analogous to the moving average crossover strategy, new positions will only be opened if the S&P500 is above
   its 200-day moving average.

4) Positions are revised weekly according to the ranks of momenta. Any stocks outside the top 20% are sold and remaining
   cash is used to buy more stocks in the top 20%, according to the position size weightings from 2). 
   
5) Updated Average True Range values are applied fortnightly (every 10 trading days), though trades only happen weekly. 

In the first part of the code (lines 44 - 92) we load S&P500 data, define the momentum of a stock and rank the stocks
within our dataset according to momenta. This is achieved using exponential regression and rolling the 90-day average:

# We observe a close match between the regression plots and their corresponding stocks. Outside of the 90 day range of
# the regression plots, the stocks do not continue on the path the regression curve would suggest. This is because our
# objective was only to order the stocks by their momenta, and not to forecast future behaviour. We have run the code
# using a dataset of only 51 stocks (those whose acronyms begin with 'A' to save time, though the algorithm can handle
# bigger datasets, and is more insightful when ran for the entire S&P500 portfolio).


# In this second part of the code we implement the momentum indicator and our strategy, and backtest to find the Sharpe
# ratio, normalised annual return and maximum drawdown of the strategy. We begin by defining momentum (as before) and
# our strategy as classes, according to the 5 axioms stated in the introduction.
#
# For backtesting I have chosen the backtrader library: https://algotrading101.com/learn/backtrader-for-backtesting/
# Backtrader iterates through historical data to evaluate our strategy in the market + simulates the execution of trades
# Backtester allows S&P500 data to be imported directly from the Yahoo Finance API (up until ~20.02.2018) which is then
# used to evaluate our strategy.
